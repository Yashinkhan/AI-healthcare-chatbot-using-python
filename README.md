In contemporary times, India faces significant challenges in providing high-quality and affordable healthcare services its expanding population, which often leads to inefficiencies in cost. The lack of healthcare access, particularly in rural regions, along with transportation issues, forces many patients to either delay their treatment or seek nearby medical facilities that often neither affordable nor suited to their specific health needs.

To address this issue, we have developed an AI Healthcare Bot system. This Python-driven platform connects patients to a chatbot that can provide accurate responses and advice to their inquiries. The system aims to deliver immediate assistance, especially during critical moments when every second counts. Additionally, it helps users locate nearby doctors, clinics, and hospitals during emergencies.

Our Python-based project includes two modules: User and Admin. Users must register to access the system and can log in with their credentials after successful registration. They can manage their profiles and change passwords as needed. Users can engage with the bot to address their health-related questions and utilize the Google Places API to find doctors and clinics close to their locations, as well as view nearby hospitals.

Admins can log in directly with their credentials to access the system, manage questions and answers, and train the model. They also have the ability to view details about registered users.

We have created our own dataset for this implementation and utilized a CNN algorithm for development, as it offers superior accuracy in predicting general disease risks compared to alternative algorithms.
